🎓 Fall 2024 Probation Status Analysis — Retention and Re-enrollment Trends using Python and Excel Pivot Table

📘 Project Overview
This project explores student retention patterns among probationary students, using synthetic data modeled after real-world university retention trends.
The goal is to understand how students with different GPA ranges during Fall 2024 progressed in subsequent semesters;  highlighting re-enrollment, dismissal, and reinstatement outcomes.
The analysis combined Python and Excel to perform data cleaning, visualization, and trend interpretation.

📊 Dataset Description
The dataset includes aggregated, simulated counts of students across the following categories:
**Variable**	**Description**
GPA Range:	GPA bracket of students during Fall 2024
Probation Fall 2024:	Number of students on probation during Fall 2024
Re-Enrolled Spring 2025:	Students from Fall 2024 probation group who re-enrolled in Spring 2025
Dismissed Spring 2025:	Students dismissed in Spring 2025 after being on probation in Fall 2024
Re-Enrolled Fall 2025	Probation:  students from Fall 2024 who re-enrolled in Fall 2025
Reinstated Spring 2025 & Re-Enrolled Fall 2025:	Students reinstated in Spring 2025 and successfully re-enrolled in Fall 2025

⚠️ All data in this project are synthetic and created for demonstration purposes only. They do not represent a real University records or results.


🧮 Tools and Methods
•	Python (Pandas): for data wrangling
•	Microsoft Excel: for data structuring, validation, and chart formatting
•	Visualization: Grouped bar charts comparing outcomes by GPA range and enrollment status/ Pivot Table

📈 Key Insights (from the synthetic analysis)
•	Lower GPA ranges correlate with higher dismissal rates and lower re-enrollment.
•	Reinstatement programs improve long-term retention for students on probation.
•	Students within mid-level GPA ranges (e.g., 1.5–1.9) show the greatest improvement in re-enrollment likelihood over time.
•	The majority of students on academic probation in Fall 2024 had a GPA between 1.5 and 1.99.
  Of this group, 90% successfully re-enrolled in Spring 2025, indicating notable academic improvement.

Overall Performance:
•	Across all students on academic probation in Fall 2024, 84% improved their grades and enrolled in Spring 2025, while 11% were dismissed.

Long-term Progress:
•	By Fall 2025, 47% of students initially on academic probation in Fall 2024 had successfully completed a full academic year.
  Specifically:
•	64% of those with a GPA of 1.5–1.99 re-enrolled in Fall 2025.
•	52% of those with a GPA of 1.0–1.49 re-enrolled.
•	34% of those with a GPA of 0.5–0.99 re-enrolled.
•	Only 14% of those with a GPA of 0.0 continued to Fall 2025.
These results suggest that students on academic probation with higher initial GPAs (above 1.0) are significantly more likely to remain enrolled and show consistent academic progress.
