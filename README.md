# 🎓 Academic Retention Analysis — Fall 2024 Probation Status

**_Data shown here are synthetic and modeled after real retention trends._**

---

## 📘 Project Overview
This project explores **student retention patterns among probationary students** using synthetic data modeled after real-world university trends.  

The goal is to understand how students with different GPA ranges in **Fall 2024** progressed in subsequent semesters, highlighting:

- Re-enrollment  
- Dismissal  
- Reinstatement outcomes  

The analysis leveraged **Python** and **Excel** for:

- Data cleaning  
- Visualization  
- Trend interpretation

## 📊 Dataset Description
The dataset contains **aggregated, simulated counts** of students in the following categories:

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **GPA Range** | GPA bracket of students during Fall 2024 |
| **Probation Fall 2024** | Number of students on probation during Fall 2024 |
| **Re-Enrolled Spring 2025** | Students from Fall 2024 probation group who re-enrolled in Spring 2025 |
| **Dismissed Spring 2025** | Students dismissed in Spring 2025 after being on probation in Fall 2024 |
| **Re-Enrolled Fall 2025 Probation** | Students from Fall 2024 who re-enrolled in Fall 2025 |
| **Reinstated Spring 2025 & Re-Enrolled Fall 2025** | Students reinstated in Spring 2025 and successfully re-enrolled in Fall 2025 |

⚠️ **Note:** All data in this project are synthetic and created for demonstration purposes only. They do not represent real university records.

## 🧮 Tools and Methods
- **Python (Pandas):** Data wrangling and manipulation  
- **Microsoft Excel:** Data structuring, validation, and chart formatting  
- **Visualization:** Grouped bar charts comparing outcomes by GPA range and enrollment status; Pivot Tables for trends

## 📈 Key Insights (Synthetic Analysis)
- **GPA vs. Outcomes:** Lower GPA ranges correlate with higher dismissal rates and lower re-enrollment.  
- **Impact of Reinstatement:** Reinstatement programs improve long-term retention for probationary students.  
- **Mid-range GPA Improvement:** Students with GPAs 1.5–1.9 show the greatest improvement in re-enrollment likelihood over time.  
- **Fall 2024 Snapshot:** Most probation students had a GPA between 1.5 and 1.99, and 90% of this group re-enrolled in Spring 2025, showing notable academic improvement.  

**Overall Performance:**
- 84% of students on academic probation in Fall 2024 improved their grades and enrolled in Spring 2025  
- 11% were dismissed  

**Long-term Progress (Fall 2025 Re-enrollment):**
- 47% of students initially on probation in Fall 2024 completed a full academic year  
- GPA 1.5–1.99 → 64% re-enrolled  
- GPA 1.0–1.49 → 52% re-enrolled  
- GPA 0.5–0.99 → 34% re-enrolled  
- GPA 0.0 → 14% re-enrolled  

> Students with higher initial GPAs (above 1.0) are significantly more likely to remain enrolled and show consistent academic progress.
